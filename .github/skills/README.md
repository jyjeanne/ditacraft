# AI Spec Review Skill

> A comprehensive AI skill that reviews markdown specifications through **14 engineering dimensions** and produces structured, actionable output — risk registers, scored dimensions, test plans, and implementation tasks.

## Why this skill?

Most spec reviews stop at "looks good" or catch only surface issues. This skill acts as a **principal-engineer-level reviewer** that systematically challenges a specification before a single line of code is written.

It doesn't just summarize — it surfaces ambiguities, contradictions, security gaps, missing edge cases, and operational blind spots, then packages everything into a format that drives engineering planning.

## Review dimensions

| # | Dimension | Grounding reference |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Specification quality | `references/spec_review.md` |
| 2 | Business logic | `references/business_logic_review.md` |
| 3 | Architecture | `references/architecture_review.md` |
| 4 | Performance & scalability | `references/performance_review.md` |
| 5 | Security (OWASP Top 10) | `references/owasp_top10.md` |
| 6 | Testing strategy & quality | `references/testing_best_practices.md` |
| 7 | DevOps / CI / CD / operability | `references/devops_ci_cd.md` |
| 8 | Dependency & supply chain | `references/dependency_review.md` |
| 9 | Standards & norms | `references/standards_and_norms.md` |
| 10 | UX | `references/ux_review.md` |
| 11 | Documentation | `references/documentation_review.md` |
| 12 | Code quality & maintainability | `references/code_quality_maintainability.md` |
| 13 | Test plan generation | `references/testing_best_practices.md` |
| 14 | Task breakdown | *(output-focused, no heuristic reference)* |

Each dimension is scored **0–10** using a five-band rubric (Critical / Weak / Adequate / Good / Excellent). The overall score is a holistic judgment, not a simple average — security, business logic, and architecture weigh more heavily.

## Structured output

The skill produces a YAML-structured review containing:

```
summary          → verdict (ready / ready_with_risks / not_ready), top risks, assumptions
issues[]         → title, severity, category, evidence, impact, recommendation
risk_register[]  → id, severity, likelihood, trigger, mitigation, owner
*_review         → dimension-specific findings (13 sections)
test_plan        → coverage matrix, edge cases, contract tests
tasks[]          → prioritized implementation tasks with acceptance criteria
score            → 14 dimension scores (0–10) + holistic overall
```

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the complete schema and field guidance.

## Install

### As a Copilot / Codex skill

```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/jyjeanne/ai-spec-review-skill.git ~/.codex/skills/ai-spec-review

# Or for other AI runtimes, clone into their equivalent skills directory
```

### As a standalone tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyjeanne/ai-spec-review-skill.git
cd ai-spec-review-skill

# Run the preflight helper on any spec
python3 scripts/review_spec.py path/to/your-spec.md
```

The preflight helper performs lightweight text heuristics (marker detection, testing/security/performance gap analysis) and outputs JSON with `summary`, `risk_register`, and `issues`. It is intentionally narrower than the full AI-driven review.

## Usage

### With an AI assistant

```
Review this specification using ai-spec-review skill
```

```
Review this specification with ai-spec-review and focus on security, performance, and business logic gaps
```

```
Use ai-spec-review to produce a structured architecture, testing, DevOps, and documentation review
```

### Preflight helper (CLI)

```bash
python3 scripts/review_spec.py spec.md
```

Output example:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "verdict": "not_ready",
    "top_risks": ["No testing strategy defined", "No security considerations mentioned"],
    ...
  },
  "risk_register": [ ... ],
  "issues": [ ... ]
}
```

## Running tests

```bash
cd scripts
python3 -m unittest test_review_spec -v
```

82 unit tests cover all helper functions: marker detection, word-boundary matching, gap detectors, verdict logic, risk register construction, and CLI integration.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

Key guidelines:

- **SKILL.md is the source of truth** — any change to review dimensions, output schema, or behavior rules starts there
- **Back dimensions with references** — heuristics belong in `references/*.md`, not buried in SKILL.md
- **Keep the helper narrow** — `review_spec.py` is a preflight tool, not the full review engine
- **Run the tests** — `python3 -m unittest test_review_spec -v` must pass before submitting
